*** In the Stylus extension you can edit the theme to your liking. (Ctrl+F and replace all hex codes to ones of your liking. Gold is #CDB87D; Navy is #1C2957).

_Note_<br/>
Make sure to keep the theme updated in the Stylus extension. Your canvas pages may look a little different than mine and have pages I was unable to edit. Sorry for any inconveniences.
